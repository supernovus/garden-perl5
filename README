Garden.pm: A Functional Template engine for Perl 5
----------------------------------------------------

Garden is the name of a Template engine I'm working on for both Perl 5 and
Perl 6. It is heavily inspired by StringTemplate from Java, but with added
features and abilities derived from Flower (my XML application engine for
Perl 6, itself inspired by and originally based on the TAL/METAL template 
engines.)

Templates written for one version of Garden should work in any implementation.

See the tests for better examples, but here's a quick one:

In './templates/testTemplate.tmpl':

  testTemplate (name, users) {{
  Hello [[name]], how are you?
  [[users.count]] users said hi:
  [[users:userList(*name, *opts)]]
  }}
  
  userList (name, opts) {{
    * [[name]]: [[opts.roles:userRoles(*role); sep=", "]] [[?opts.leader:Leader()]]
  }}

  userRoles (role) {{ #[[userRoles.number]] [[role]] }}

  Leader () {{ -- Is a team leader. }}

In './test.pl':

  use Garden;
  my $garden = Garden->new(paths=>['./templates']);
  my $test   = $garden->get("testTemplate");
  my $data   = {
    name  => "World",
    users => {
      Bob    => { roles => ['user'],          leader => 0 },
      Kevin  => { roles => ['user','admin'],  leader => 0 },
      Joe    => { roles => ['user','tester'], leader => 1 },
    },
  };
  say $test->render($data);

Should print the following text:

  Hello World, how are you?
  3 users said hi:
    * Bob: #1 user
    * Joe: #1 user, #2 tester -- Is a team leader.
    * Kevin: #1 user, #2 admin

If you are wondering why the names are in a different order, it's because
in Perl, hashes return results unsorted. We're sorting the keys by name.

Oh, and a lot of the syntax such as the {{, }}, [[, ]], etc. is configurable,
on a per file basis, so if you want different markers, it's easy to change
them. The defaults are used above.

That shows off a few features, but there's plenty more in the tests.
