Garden.pm: A Functional Template engine for Perl 5
----------------------------------------------------

Garden is the name of a Template engine I'm working on for both Perl 5 and
Perl 6. It is heavily inspired by StringTemplate from Java, but with added
features and abilities derived from Flower (my XML application engine for
Perl 6, itself inspired by and originally based on the TAL/METAL template 
engines.)

Templates written for one version of Garden should work in any implementation.

See the tests for better examples, but here's a quick one:

In './templates/testTemplate.tmpl':

  testTemplate (name, users) {{
  Hello [[name]], how are you?
  [[users.count]] users said hi:
  [[users:userList(*name, *opts)]]
  }}
  
  userList (name, opts) {{
    * [[name]]: [[opts.roles:userRoles(*role); sep=", "]]
  }}

  userRoles (role) {{ #[[userRoles.number]] [[role]] }}

In './test.pl':

  use Garden;
  my $garden = $garden->new(paths=>['./templates']);
  my $test   = $garden->get("testTemplate");
  my $data   = {
    name  => "World",
    users => {
      Bob    => { roles => ['user'] },
      Kevin  => { roles => ['user','admin'] },
    },
  };
  say $test->render($data);

Should print the following text:

  Hello World, how are you?
  2 users said hi:
    * Bob: #1 user
    * Kevin: #1 user, #2 admin

That shows off a few features, but there's plenty more in the tests.
