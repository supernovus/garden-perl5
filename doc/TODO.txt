## Things I'm planning to do, and in which order I plan to do them.
##
## Priorities:
##
##  **** This MUST be included in the target.
##  **   This SHOULD be included in the target.
##  *    This COULD be included in the target.
##
## If a COULD or SHOULD item doesn't make it in the target
## it will be moved to the next target.

= Things to do for version 1.0 =

***  Tests for 'import' statement.
***  Tests for 'include' statement.
**   Tests for syntax overrides.
*    Plugins, for extra functionality.

= Potential future ideas (2.x or later.) =

*    Anonymous templates.
*    Multiple dispatch based on signature?
