## Priorities:

##  **** This MUST be included in the target.
##  **   This SHOULD be included in the target.
##  *    This COULD be included in the target.

## If a COULD or SHOULD item doesn't make it in the target
## it will be moved to the next target.

= Things to do for version 1.0 =

***  Tests for 'import' statement.
***  Tests for 'include' statement.
**   Tests for syntax overrides.

= Things to do for version 2.0 =

***  Rewrite the Template parser to use Regexp::Grammers.
     Currently you can't do things like [[obj.method(another.property)]]
     as the split on attribs turns that into ["method(another",property]
     which is certainly not correct. The work around at the time being
     is to use aliases if you need to pass things in method calls.
     Using grammars will give us a lot more flexibility.
***  Anonymous templates. These will be easier with Regexp::Grammars.
***  Multiple dispatch based on signature.
