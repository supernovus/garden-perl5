= Things to do in version 1.1 =

***  Update to a completed Spec Release 1.
     I jumped the gun releasing 1.0 before I'd finished
     fleshing out the spec. I don't want to withdraw it,
     but instead will replace it with 1.1 which will support
     more import rules, and use statements.

= Things to do in upcoming 1.x releases =

**   Add ability to load templates/namespaces from strings.
**   Tweak grammar for flexibility, speed, etc.

= Things to do for version 2.0 =

*    Anonymous templates.
